 For some reason. the chomd command did not work for my project....Video... 10:10 min . . When changing the permission for your the bin file there is huge difference between "chmod +x bin_blacklapel" and chomd...... The spelling can make a differences in your code...

 So what is a Deal... and who do we like it so much .
  A deal must have name , price, Url or link availability

Then. Turn the assume code into real life data for use. This help with making the site.. Really work as we scrape blacklapel and macys sites. However, this site did not work as planned so we changed them to the menswearhouse.

 **** I realize that there is huge difference between .. require_relative and require.... such an eye opener. ***

  Did A mistake with the line 27 in deals by not add a string to the website.

  Scraping process...
  created self.scrape_manswearhouse
     And the doc = Nokogiri::HTML(open("website"))
     pry.
  then I called the file like this
   ./bin/console  
   then
    Blacklapel::Deal.scrape_blacklapel
      ###then scraping begans.

      A huge tool that helped with this is the Selector Gadget install on my chromo Browser......
       How to use ....
       Click on a page element that you would like your selector to match (it will turn green). SelectorGadget will then generate a minimal CSS selector for that element, and will highlight (yellow) everything that is matched by the selector. Now click on a highlighted element to reject it (red), or click on an unhighlighted element to add it (green). Through this process of selection and rejection, SelectorGadget helps you to come up with the perfect CSS selector for your needs.

       Holding 'shift' while moving the mouse will let you select elements inside of other selected elements.
       ....


 So we want to iterate two level deeps... within the code. scrape 2 levels deep.  deal 1 or deal 2 t
