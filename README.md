# Blacklapel

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/blacklapel`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
type Install "bundle install"
```ruby
gem 'blacklapel'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install blacklapel

## Usage

 Once you open up the suit directory, you want to load up the Bundler by typing   Install Bundle by typing in the bundle install .
 Also makes use that you have SelectorGadget install on you chromo browser as this would save you lot of time in the scraping world.

 The user can type in ./bin/bin_blacklapel to start the CLI.
 Then the CLI will list all the deals that are available to us for MensWearHouse for that day.
 The user can user can enter a numerical input get more more information about deals on suits.
 The user can type exit the program to exit the program.

## Development
After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
